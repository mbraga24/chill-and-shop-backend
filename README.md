## Description

Users can create two different accounts. They can create a store (sellers) or just **Chill & Shop** (buyers). Store owners and buyers will have a dashboard to keep track of their purchases (buyers), products to be delivered(sellers), an archived of delivered products(sellers), and an overall stats of their earnings, expenses, and profits (sellers) delivered by graphics and chars (this is a stretch feature currently unavailable).

I'm excited to keep working on this project and expand its features and capabilities.

#### Inspiration

This project was inspired on an application assessment for a backend internship role for [Shopify](shorturl.at/iCTY8). Unfortunately I could't complete all the requirements before submission but I decided to keep working on it to learn more about how to develop those specific features and challenge myself to finish, if not all, at least most of the requirements for the that assessment.
